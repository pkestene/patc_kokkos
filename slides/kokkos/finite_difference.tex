  \hypertarget{handson4}{}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Purpose:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Illustrate the use of 2D/3D \texttt{Kokkos::View}
    \item Illustrate the use of alternative execution policies: \texttt{Kokkos::Experimental::MDRangePolicy}, \texttt{Kokkos::TeamPolicy},...
    \end{itemize}
  \item Stencil kernel:
    \begin{minted}[autogobble,obeytabs=true,tabsize=2]{c++}
      for (int k=0; k<nz; ++k)
        for (int j=0; j<ny; ++j)
          for (int i=0; i<nx; ++i) {
            y(i,j,k) = -5*x(i,j,k) +
              ( x(i-1,j  ,k  ) + x(i+1,j  ,k  ) +
                x(i  ,j-1,k  ) + x(i  ,j+1,k  ) +
                x(i  ,j  ,k-1) + x(i  ,j  ,k+1) );
          }
