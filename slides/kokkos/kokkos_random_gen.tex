  \begin{itemize}
  \item Activity: \textcolor{red}{\bf Estimating Pi via Monte Carlo}
  \item purpose: learn to use the {\bf random number generator} features (built-in Kokkos)
  \item Draw random points in $[0,1]^2$ and compute the fraction of points inside the unit circle:
    \includegraphics[width=2.5cm]{images/MonteCarloPiMod_gr_25}
  \item These generators are based on Vigna, Sebastiano (2014). {\it An experimental exploration of Marsaglia's xorshift generators, scrambled.} \myurl{http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6246}
  \item Use code in \texttt{code/handson/6/compute\_pi}; read \texttt{readme} file; fill the holes
  \item Which compute pattern will you use ? \texttt{parallel\_for}, \texttt{parallel\_reduce}, \texttt{parallel\_scan} ?
  \end{itemize}

  {\bf \large Random number generator in Kokkos: the big picture}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Kokkos defines tuple of types (\textcolor{red}{RNG state}, \textcolor{blue}{RNG pool})\\
    e.g. (\texttt{Random\_XorShift64}, \texttt{Random\_XorShift64\_Pool})
  \item Kokkos defines several type of random generator, the main object is a \textcolor{blue}{\bf random number generator pool} of \textcolor{red}{\it RNG states}, e.g. \textcolor{blue}{\bf \texttt{Kokkos::Random\_XorShift64\_Pool}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item this is a template class, which takes a Kokkos device as template parameter (Kokkos::OpenMP, Kokkos::Cuda, ...)
    \item the pool constructor takes an integral seed to initialize, (option) the number of states in pool
    \item it is basically an array of {\it RNG states}
    \end{itemize}
  \item A random generator pool defines a subtype to store a given random generator \textcolor{red}{\bf internal state}: so that inside a functor, one would find:\\
    \texttt{using rng\_state\_t = GeneratorPool::generator\_type}
  \item rule of thumb:\\
    One pool $\Leftrightarrow$ one functor\\
    One rng\_state $\Leftrightarrow$ (use by) one thread
