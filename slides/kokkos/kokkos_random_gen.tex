  \frametitle{Hands-On 6 : Random number generator with Kokkos}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Activity: \textcolor{red}{\bf Estimating Pi via Monte Carlo}
  \item purpose: learn to use the {\bf random number generator} features (built-in Kokkos)
  \item Draw random points in $[0,1]^2$ and compute the fraction of points inside the unit circle:

  \item These generators are based on Vigna, Sebastiano (2014). {\it An experimental exploration of Marsaglia's xorshift generators, scrambled.} \myurl{http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6246}
  \item Use code in ...
