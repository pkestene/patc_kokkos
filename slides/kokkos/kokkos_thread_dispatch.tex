    this macro helps providing the necessary compiler specific \textit{decorators}, e.g. \texttt{\_\_device\_\_} for Cuda to make sure the body can be turns into a Cuda kernel.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item As for \texttt{parallel\_for}, loop body can be specified as a \textcolor{blue}{\bf lambda}, or a \textcolor{darkgreen}{\bf functor}; here is the lambda way when reduce operation is \texttt{sum}:
  \end{itemize}
  {\small
    \begin{minted}{c++}
      // - local_sum is a temporary variable to transfer intermediate result
      //   between threads (or block of threads)
      // - sum contains the final reduced result

         KOKKOS_LAMBDA (const int i, int &local_sum) {
           local_sum += data(i);
         },
         sum);
       \end{minted}
       \begin{itemize}
       \item Important note: using \texttt{parallel\_reduce} with lambda is only really usefull if the reduce operation $'+'$
       \item If the reduce operation is something else, you need to specify:\\
         - how the local result is initialized (default 0)\\
         - how the different intermediate results are {\it joined}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Kokkos supplies a default \texttt{init} / \texttt{join} operator which is \texttt{operator+}
  \item If the reduce operator is not trivial (i.e. not a sum) $\Rightarrow$ you need to define methods \texttt{init} and \texttt{join}
  \end{itemize}
