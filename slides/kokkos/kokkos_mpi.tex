  \item \textcolor{red}{\bf How to build an MPI application when \texttt{KOKKOS\_DEVICE} is Cuda ?}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Solution 1: Use \texttt{mpicxx} and pass env variable \texttt{OMPI\_CXX=nvcc\_wrapper}~\footnote{Use MPICH\_CXX if your MPI implementation is MPICH.}
    \item Solution 2: Use \texttt{nvcc\_wrapper} as the compiler, but modify \texttt{CXX\_FLAGS} / \texttt{LDFLAGS} to add MPI specific flags.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\bf How to make sure everything is ok regarding hardware affinity ? }
    \textcolor{darkgreen}{\textbf{Cross-check at all possible level !}} (so many ways to go wrong)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Use \texttt{mpirun \--\--report-bindings} to cross-check afterwards how the job scheduler mapped the MPI task to core/host.
    \item Use \texttt{Kokkos::print\_configuration}
    \item {\bf Check MPI task - GPU binding is what you expect it to be in the application.}
