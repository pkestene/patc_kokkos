    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Kokkos}} is a \textbf{C++ library} with \textcolor{red}{\textbf{parallel algorithmic patterns}} AND \textcolor{red}{\textbf{data containers}} for \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{node-level parallelism}}.
    \item Implementation relies heavily on \textbf{meta-programing} to derive native {\bf low-level code (OpenMP, Pthreads, CUDA, ...)} and adapt data structure {\bf memory layout} at compile-time
    \item Core developers at \textcolor{violet}{\bf SANDIA NL} (\textbf{H.C. Edwards, C. Trott})

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{\textbf{Open source}}, \myurl{https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos}
    \item Primarily developped as a base building layer for \textbf{generic high-performance parallel linear algebra} in \myhref{https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos}{Trilinos}
    \item Also used in molecular dynamics code, e.g. \myhref{http://lammps.sandia.gov/}{LAMMPS}
    \item Goal: \textcolor{orange}{\textbf{ISO/C++ 2020 Standard}} subsumes Kokkos abstractions
