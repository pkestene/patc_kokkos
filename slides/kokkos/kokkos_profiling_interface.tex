  \frametitle{Kokkos profiling interface (1)}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Kokkos provides by default a \textcolor{violet}{profiling interface} through a {\bf plugin mechanism}
  \item {\bf Usage: \textcolor{darkgreen}{profiling / monitoring / instrumenting}}
  \item From an application point of view, there is nothing to do, just provide a plugin (shared library), e.g.
    \begin{minted}{bash}
      # define path to the plugin
      export KOKKOS_PROFILE_LIBRARY=/somewhere/kp_kernel_logger.so
      # run as usal Kokkos application
    \end{minted}
  \item Examples of Kokkos profile plugins can be found at\\
    \myurl{https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-tools}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A Kokkos profile plugin must provide implementation for callback routines
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{kokkosp\_init\_library}
    \item \texttt{kokkosp\_finalize\_library}
    \end{itemize}
  \item A Kokkos profile interface can provide implementation for callback routines specific to a type a parallel construct, e.g. \texttt{Kokkos::parallel\_for}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{kokkosp\_begin\_parallel\_for}
    \item \texttt{kokkosp\_end\_parallel\_for}
    \end{itemize}
    which are called every time application enters / exits this construct.
    \item see file \texttt{core/src/impl/Kokkos\_Profiling\_Interface.cpp} for a detailed list of possible callbacks.
  \end{itemize}
