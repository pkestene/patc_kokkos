  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{Kokkos::View<double **> data("data",NX,NY);}} : 2D array with sizes known at runtime
  \item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{Kokkos::View<double *[3]> data("data",NX);}} : 2D array with first size known at runtime ($NX$), and second known at compile time (3).
  \item \fbox{How do I access data ? $data(i,j)$ !} {\it a la Fortran}
  \item \textcolor{orange}{\bf Which memory space ?} By default, the default device memory space !\\
    Want to enforce in which memory space lives the view ? 
    \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{Kokkos::View<..., Device>}}: if a second template parameter is given, Kokkos expects a \texttt{Device} (e.g. \texttt{Kokkos::OpenMP}, \texttt{Kokkos::Cuda}, ...)
  \item \texttt{Kokkos::View} are \textbf{small}, designed as reference to allocated memory buffer
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{orange}{View = pointer to data + metadata(array shape, layout, ... )}
    \item assignment is fast (shallow copy + increment ref counter)~\footnote{NB: same behaviour as in python for example}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Kokkos::View} are designed to be pass by value to a function ({\bf no hard copy}).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Concept of \textbf{memory layout:}
  \item \textbf{Memory layout is crucial for performance:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{LayoutLeft}}: $data(i,j,k)$ uses linearized index as $i + NX*j + NX*NY * k$ (column-major order)
    \item \textcolor{red}{\textbf{LayoutRight}}: $data(i,j,k)$ uses linearized index as $k + NZ*j + NZ*NY * i$ (raw-major order)
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\texttt{Kokkos::View<int**, Kokkos::OpenMP>} defaults with LayoutRight}; a single thread access contiguous entries of the array. Better for cache and avoid sharing cache lines between threads.
  \item \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{Kokkos::View<int**, Kokkos::Cuda>} defaults LayoutLeft} so that consecutive threads in the same warp access consecutive entries in memory; try to ensure memory coalescence constraint
  \item You can if you like, still enforce memory layout yourself (or just use 1D Views, and compute index yourself);\\
    We will see the 2 possibilities with the miniApp on the Fisher equation
