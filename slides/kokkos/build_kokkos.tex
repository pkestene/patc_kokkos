  \textbf{0. Kokkos is still experimental, but moving fast: use git sources}
  
  \textbf{1. Get Kokkos sources, development branch - don't try to build yet !}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{blue}{Practicals on \texttt{ouessant}:}\\
    \textcolor{darkgreen}{\texttt{1. mkdir \$HOME/kokkos-tutorial; cd \$HOME/kokkos-tutorial}}\\
    some kokkos tutorial examples have a Makefile configured for using that precise location.\\
    \textcolor{darkgreen}{\texttt{2. git clone https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos}}\\
    \textcolor{darkgreen}{\texttt{3. cd kokkos; git checkout develop}}

  \textbf{2. How to build and use}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\textbf{As a regular library (standalone Makefile, installed library):}} \\
    \begin{itemize}
    \item {\bf not recommended} for production level (see below), {\bf OK for testing and building examples}
    \item use \texttt{generate\_makefile.bash}, then \texttt{make kokkoslib; make install}\\
      Then use a \textit{modulefile} to configure the environment\\
      Kokkos examples (inside source) can be built that way, as well as \myhref{https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-tutorials}{Kokkos-tutorials}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{Embedded Kokkos source files in your application}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Why ?
    \item $\Rightarrow$ Kokkos by design has {\bf many different configurations possible} (hardware adaptability, heavily relies on C++ metaprograming - compile timing )
    \item $\Rightarrow$ best practice advice : better compile kokkos as part as the target application (same flags, same compiler, etc...)
    \item $\Rightarrow$ \textcolor{blue}{\bf recommended use}:
    \textcolor{darkgreen}{\bf standalone \myhref{https://cmake.org/}{cmake} + kokkos sources embedded in your application} (we'll see a skeleton app)
    \end{itemize}
  \item There exists another cmake-based build sytem, but relies on a third-party tools \myhref{https://tribits.org/}{TriBITS}. Right now this can only be used used when Kokkos is build inside \myhref{https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos}{Trilinos} (heterogeneous distributed sparse and dense linear algebra package).

  {\bf \textcolor{red}{About standalone Makefile} and environment variables settings for building on multiple architectures}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The following variables are usefull when building some of the tutorial examples :
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{KOKKOS\_PATH}: path to Kokkos source dir
    \item \texttt{KOKKOS\_DEVICES}: define possible execution spaces: CUDA, OpenMP, Pthreads, Serial, ...
    \item \texttt{KOKKOS\_ARCH}: used to customize compiler flags; e.g. Power8, Kepler35, SNB, KNL, ARMv80, ROCm, ...
    \end{itemize}
  \item When building for \textcolor{darkgreen}{\bf CUDA device}, you'll need to use Kokkos' own compiler wrapper: \textcolor{darkgreen}{\texttt{\bf nvcc\_wrapper}} (included in Kokkos sources), not just \texttt{nvcc}
  \item \textcolor{red}{When building Kokkos and aiming at an installed Kokkos}, the same information (in a different form) is passed to script \texttt{generate\_makefile.bash}\\
    Just type \texttt{./generate\_makefile.bash \--\--help} at top-level Kokkos sources
  \item \textcolor{blue}{When using Kokkos embedded in your application}, these variables must be set on the \texttt{make} command line.

    \begin{itemize}
    \item For \texttt{ouessant}, see file \texttt{doc/readme\_build\_kokkos\_ouessant} in the provided archive
    \item Serial (mostly for testing)\\
      \texttt{../generate\_makefile.bash --with-serial --prefix=\$HOME/local/kokkos\_serial}

    \end{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{\textbf{After installation}} (\texttt{make kokkoslib; make install;}) the file \textbf{\texttt{Makefile.kokkos}} is created, and designed to be reused in your application build system.
  \item \textbf{Two choices for integrating Kokkos in your app:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Use an existing Makefile from Kokkos tutorial, examples, ...
    \item Use your own build system ({\bf cmake recommended}): there can be a quite large combinatorics of \texttt{DEVICES}, \texttt{ARCH}, compilers, compiler options, ...
