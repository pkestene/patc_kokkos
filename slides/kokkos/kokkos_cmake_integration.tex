  \begin{itemize}
  \item Why Cmake ?
    \begin{itemize}
    \item cmake is supported by kokkos
    \item easy to integrate and configure (versus e.g. old autotools, versus regular Makefile): need to handle the architecture flags combinatorics
    \end{itemize}
  \item User application top-level cmake can be as small as 7 lines
