  {\large\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Purpose:} just cross-checking Kokkos/Hwloc is working OK}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item We will first re-use material from Kokkos github repository.
  \item On your home, on \texttt{ouessant}: 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{mkdir kokkos-tutorial; cd kokkos-tutorial}
    \item \texttt{git clone https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos.git} \\
      \# \textbf{Don't try to build kokkos here (for now)}
    %\item \texttt{git clone https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-tutorials.git}
    %\item \texttt{cd kokkos-tutorials/1-Day-Tutorial}\\
    %  \# 1 Day tutorial exercice are routed to \textbf{build kokkos for you}
    \end{enumerate}

  {\large\textcolor{red}{\textbf{Purpose:} just cross-checking Kokkos/Hwloc is working OK}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Kokkos sources will be built by the application Makefile
  \item \texttt{cd \$HOME/kokkos-tutorial/kokkos/example/query\_device}
  \item open \texttt{query\_device.cpp}; no computations, it just prints hardware information
  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Default serial build (with hwloc):} \texttt{make KOKKOS\_USE\_TPLS="hwloc"}\\
      How many NUMA / Cores / Hyperthreads on power8 CPU ?\\
      What is the current SMT mode on a ouessant login node ? (use command \texttt{ppc64\_cpu \--\--smt} or \texttt{ppc64\_cpu --info})
    \item \textbf{OpenMP build (with hwloc):} \texttt{make KOKKOS\_USE\_TPLS="hwloc" KOKKOS\_DEVICES=OpenMP} (off course, exact same information obtained)
    \item \textbf{CUDA/OpenMP build (with hwloc):} \texttt{make KOKKOS\_USE\_TPLS="hwloc" KOKKOS\_DEVICES=Cuda,OpenMP}; rerun and you should get information about the CPU+GPU configuration
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Take some time to have a look at the Makefile.}\\
    Note that latter when using an installed kokkos library, we won't need to set architecture or device related variables on the command line .

    \item Add \texttt{Kokkos::finalize();} before \texttt{MPI\_Finalize}
