  {\large \textcolor{red}{\bf Purpose:} The simplest computing kernel in Kokkos, importance of hwloc}

  % penser à refactorer le timer, pas du tout adapté aux mesures de perf GPU.
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There 5 differents versions
  \item \textbf{1. Serial : no Kokkos)}
  \item \textbf{2. OpenMP : no Kokkos)}
  \item 3. Kokkos-Lambda-CPU : Kokkos with lambda for threads dispatch
  \item \textbf{4. Kokkos-Lambda : Kokkos with lambda for threads dispatch and data buffer (Kokkos::View)}
  \item 5. Kokkos-Functor-CPU : Kokkos with functor for threads dispatch only
  \end{itemize}

  {\large \textcolor{red}{\bf Proposed activity (get the sources):}}
  {\small
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item First, make sure you cloned kokkos sources inside \texttt{\${HOME}/kokkos-tutorial}:\\
      \textcolor{magenta}{\texttt{mkdir -p \${HOME}/kokkos-tutorial; cd \${HOME}/kokkos-tutorial}}\\
      \textcolor{magenta}{\texttt{git clone  https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos.git}}
    %\item Download \texttt{kokkos-tutorials} sources (anywhere in \texttt{\${HOME}}):\\
     % \textcolor{magenta}{\texttt{git clone https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-tutorials.git}}
    %\item \textcolor{magenta}{\texttt{cd kokkos-tutorials/Intro-Full/SNL2015/Exercises/01\_AXPY}}
    \item From the provided material \textcolor{magenta}{\texttt{cd patc\_kokkos/code/handson/2/saxpy}}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{red}{\textbf{Saxpy serial (reference executable on Power8)}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{cd handson/2/saxpy/Serial}
    \item \texttt{make KOKKOS\_ARCH=Power8}
    \item Alternatively, we could have modified \texttt{Makefile} and changed \texttt{SNB} (Sandy Bridge) into \texttt{Power8}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textcolor{orange}{\textbf{Saxpy regular OpenMP (on Power8)}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{cd handson/2/saxpy/OpenMP}
    \item Rebuild: \texttt{make KOKKOS\_ARCH=Power8}; and observe performance by change vector size
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \item \textcolor{violet}{\textbf{Saxpy Kokkos OpenMP (on Power8)}}~\footnote{Make sure to use a very large data array; Power8 has very large cache memory. If you don't, this example will not measure memory bandwith. Maximum bandwidth is 230 GB/s on a 2 socket P8. You should measure around 170 GB/s.}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{cd handson/2/saxpy/Kokkos-Lambda}
    \item Add the following lines in \texttt{saxpy.cpp} right after Kokkos initialization
      {\scriptsize
      \begin{minted}[autogobble=true]{c++}
        std::ostringstream msg;
        if ( Kokkos::hwloc::available() ) {
          msg << "hwloc( NUMA[" << Kokkos::hwloc::get_available_numa_count()
          << "] x CORE["    << Kokkos::hwloc::get_available_cores_per_numa()
          << "] x HT["      << Kokkos::hwloc::get_available_threads_per_core()
          << "] )"
          << std::endl ;
        }
        
        Kokkos::print_configuration( msg );
        std::cout << msg.str();
      \end{minted}
    }
    \item \texttt{make KOKKOS\_ARCH=Power8}
    \item Make sure all available CPU cores were used ($1\times 160 \times 1$)
    \item Change the number of OpenMP threads created by kokkos, e.g. :\\
      \texttt{./saxpy.host  --threads=20}
    \item Add again \texttt{KOKKOS\_USE\_TPLS="hwloc"} on the command line\\
      Rebuild and rerun, you should see that application uses \textbf{all the available numa domains}, and a strongly increased bandwidth usage !

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{cd handson/2/saxpy/Kokkos-Lambda}
    \item \texttt{module load at/10.0 cuda/9.2}
    \end{itemize}
  \item Rebuild for K80, run on ouessant (front node):\\
    \texttt{make KOKKOS\_DEVICES="Cuda,OpenMP" KOKKOS\_ARCH="Kepler37,Power8" KOKKOS\_USE\_TPLS="hwloc"}
  \item Rebuild for P100, run on compute node using \texttt{submit\_ouessant.sh} (should see a strong difference):\\
    \texttt{make KOKKOS\_DEVICES="Cuda,OpenMP" KOKKOS\_ARCH="Pascal60,Power8" KOKKOS\_USE\_TPLS="hwloc"}\\
    Please note that \textbf{maximun bandwith is 732 GB/s for Pascal P100}, you can retrieve this number by examining \texttt{deviceQuery} example in CUDA/SDK.
