  From a pure software engineering point of view, how does {\bf Kokkos} manage to turn \textcolor{red}{\bf a pur C++ functor} into a \textcolor{darkgreen}{\bf CUDA kernel} ?

  \item entry point of parallel computation is through \texttt{parallel\_for} (function call, templated by execution policy, functor, ...)
    \begin{minted}[autogobble=true]{c++}
      // parallel_for is defined in

  \item \texttt{closure} is an instance of the {\bf driver} class \texttt{Kokkos::Impl::ParallelFor}; the precise object type created is off course Kokkos-backend dependent
    % Kokkos_Parallel.hpp : line 221
    % Impl::ParallelFor< FunctorType , policy > closure( functor , policy(0,work_count) );
  \item If CUDA backend is activated, the instantiated class \texttt{Kokkos::Impl::ParallelFor} is defined in \texttt{Cuda/Kokkos\_Cuda\_Parallel.hpp}; there are multiple specialization for the different execution policies (Range, multi-dimensional range, team policy, ...); e.g. for range

  \item when \texttt{closure.execute()} is called, an object \texttt{CudaParallellaunch} is created
  \item struct \texttt{CudaParallellaunch} contains only a constructor, which only purpose is to actually launch the CUDA kernel (using the $<<<$ ... $>>>$ syntax)
  \item Copy closure (driver instance) to GPU memory (either constant, local or global) using Cuda API (e.g \texttt{cudaMemcpyToSymbolAsync} to copy constant memory space)
  \item finally the actual generated cuda kernel, using one of the static functions defined (e.g. \texttt{cuda\_parallel\_launch\_constant\_memory})
