  \begin{itemize}
  \item See \textcolor{blue}{kokkos basic version} from \texttt{code/handson/3/mandelbrot\_kokkos/kokkos\_basic} (already a bit refactored to ease the job)
  \end{itemize}
  %
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item we added a file \textcolor{blue}{\texttt{kokkos\_shared.h}}: \texttt{std::vector} replaced by a \texttt{Kokkos::View}
  \item \textcolor{orange}{\textbf{TODO:}} fill TODOs in \texttt{mandelbrot.h} containing the definition of the c++ mandelbrot kokkos functor.\\
    \textbf{Notice:} the global constants have disappeared, they are now part of the functor context.
  \item \textcolor{orange}{\textbf{TODO:}} refactor \texttt{main.cpp} (change the TODO)
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Modify data allocation (from \texttt{std::vector} to \texttt{Kokkos::View}); we have now arrays: \texttt{image} and \texttt{imageHost} (mirror)
    \item Copy back results from device to host.

  \item Pipelined version of Mandelbrot is not currently fully functional; it requires a small patch applied to \texttt{Kokkos} for \texttt{cudaStreams};\\
    see \myurl{https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/issues/532}
  \item Understand what is pipelined version of Mandelbrot see:
    {\scriptsize \myurl{http://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2015/webinar/openacc-course/advanced-openacc-techniques.pdf}}\\
    It basically consists in overlapping GPU computations with CPU/GPU memory transfert.
  \item See explanations given during training
