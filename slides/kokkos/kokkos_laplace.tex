  \frametitle{Hands-On 5 : Laplace solver with KOKKOS + MPI}

  \hypertarget{handson5}{}
  \textbf{Slightly adapted/refactored from Nvidia's OpenACC exercise:}\\
  \myhref{https://github.com/NVIDIA-OpenACC-Course/nvidia-advanced-openacc-course-sources}{nvidia-advanced-openacc-course-sources}

  We will use code from \myurl{code/handson/5/laplace_kokkos}, 4 different versions of the 2D Laplace solver:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item serial (no kokkos)
  \item \textcolor{violet}{\bf kokkos with 1D view} (linearized index)
  \item kokkos\_v2 with 2D views
  \item \textcolor{violet}{\bf kokkos\_mpi with MPI+CUDA and hwloc}
  \end{itemize}

  {\bf Please note that this exercise uses the old Makefile (no cmake)\\
    $\Rightarrow$ you need to set env variable KOKKOS\_PATH to the \\
    kokkos source directory.
  }
