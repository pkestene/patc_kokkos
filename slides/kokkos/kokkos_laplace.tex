  \frametitle{Hands-On 5 : Laplace solver with KOKKOS + MPI}

  Slightly adapted from Nvidia's OpenACC exercise:\\
  \myhref{https://github.com/NVIDIA-OpenACC-Course/nvidia-advanced-openacc-course-sources}{nvidia-advanced-openacc-course-sources}

  We will use code from \myurl{code/exercises/laplace_kokkos}, 4 different versions of the 2D Laplace solver:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item serial (no kokkos)
  \item kokkos with 1D viewd (linearized index)
  \item kokkos\_v2 with 2D views
  \item kokkos\_mpi with MPI+CUDA and hwloc
  \end{itemize}
