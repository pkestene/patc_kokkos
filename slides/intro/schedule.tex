  \begin{itemize}
  \item Monday + Tuesday morning : NVidia OpenACC tutorial
  \item Tuesday afternoon + Wednesday : Kokkos tutorial
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Introduction performance portability
    \item IBM Power8 + Nvidia Pascal P100 platform : short overview
    \item Kokkos: features overview
    \item Hands-on : retrieve Kokkos sources, how to build, how to run a \textit{helloworld} application, explore different configurations
    \item Replay some tutorial slides from SC2016 for deeper Kokkos concepts
    \item Simple example : the Mandelbrot set
    \item Hands-On with exercice Laplace : with Kokkos, with Kokkos+ MPI + Hwloc
    \item Hands-On with a miniApp from CSCS: Fisher equation solver\\
      $\Rightarrow$ use Kokkos lambda
    \item Another miniApp: CFD Euler solver\\
      $\Rightarrow$ measure performance for several Kokkos backends (OpenMP, CUDA)
    \end{itemize}
