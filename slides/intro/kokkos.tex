    \item Implementation relies heavily on \textbf{meta-programing} to derive native low-level code (OpenMP, Pthreads, CUDA, ...) and adapt data structure memory layout at compile-time
    \item Core developers at \textcolor{violet}{\textbf{SANDIA NL}} (\textbf{H.C. Edwards, C. Trott})

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{darkgreen}{\textbf{Open source}}, \myurl{https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos}
    \item Primarily developped as a base building layer for \textbf{generic high-performance parallel linear algebra} in \myhref{https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos}{Trilinos}
    \item Also used in molecular dynamics code, e.g. \myhref{http://lammps.sandia.gov/}{LAMMPS}
    \item Goal: \textcolor{orange}{\textbf{ISO/C++ 2020 Standard}} subsumes Kokkos abstractions~\footnote{see mdspan proposal \myurl{https://github.com/kokkos/array_ref}}
