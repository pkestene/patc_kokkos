This is a minimal tpetra application using cmake.

Tpetra_Vector.cpp is taken from trilinos tutorial:
https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos_tutorial/tree/master/beginner/Tpetra_Vector

To build, you only need to setup environment variable TRILINOS_PATH
to the directory where trilinos was installed.

1. mkdir build; cd build
2. ccmake ..
3. make
