Provide a minimal script to launch an executable (no MPI, just access a GPU)
on a compute node of ouessant.

- Copy this script (submit_ouessant.sh) in nvidia samples (samples/1_Utility/deviceQuery)
- run:
  bsub < submit_ouessant.sh

- when finished, you should see the job output written in a file like this : test_device_query.????.out
  where question mark are replaced by the actual job id.
