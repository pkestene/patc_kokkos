Kokkos must be configured with hwloc.

This example is the most simple thing you think of:
just initialize MPI, then Kokkos, and finaly check
how MPI ranks and GPU are binded.

example: on a node with 2 GPUs
mpirun -np 2 ./test_mpi.cpu --ndevices=2
you should see the correct binding

If you omit option "--ndevices=2", all MPI tasks will use the same GPU (#0)
